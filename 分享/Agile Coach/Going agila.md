# Stop "Going Agile"!

别再“追求敏捷”了！

The three conversations you need to have before you start

在开始之前你需要进行的3个对话

All too often, companies set out with the mission to "go agile" before truly understanding what that means. Cracks begin to show and expectations are missed, leaving everyone questioning the value of "going agile" altogether – and hurting your chances of ever getting there.

很多时候，公司真正理解这意味着什么之前就开始了走向敏捷的使命，然后裂缝开始出现，期望落空，让每个人都质疑敏捷的价值，并损坏了你实现目标的机会。

The truth is that going agile will result in more productive teams and faster delivery of projects, but only if everyone can agree on the rules of the game. Join Heather Fleming and Justin Riservato, from e-commerce giant Gilt, as they discuss why gaining consensus on the principles of agile is more important than implementing a process.

事实是敏捷将导致团队更加高效，项目交付更快，但前提是每个人都能够就游戏规则达成一致。来自电子商务巨头Gilt的Join Heather Fleming和Justin Riservato一起讨论了为什么就敏捷原则达成共识比实施流程更重要。

Specifically, Heather and Justin explore the answers to three vital questions that any team needs to be prepared to answer prior to embarking on the agile journey:

具体来说，Heather和Justin探索了任何团队在开始敏捷之前都需要准备好回答三个重要问题的答案。

- "But when will you be done?" Why getting rid of the concept of deadlines is the most important (and most difficult) conversation when going agile.
- "This is my top priority, but I can't meet with you until next week." What to do when your business partner can't (or won't) be a full member of the team.
- "I just want to code. Why do I have to be in all these meetings?" Why implementing Scrum is not the first step to going agile.

- “但是你什么时候完成？”为什么摆脱最后期限是敏捷最重要（最难）的对话
- “这是我首要的任务，但是我要到下周才能见到你”当你的业务合作伙伴不能（或不会）成为团队的正式成员该怎么办
- “我只想编码，为什么要我参加这些会议？”为什么实施Scrum不是敏捷的第一步

Q & A

Here, Heather and Justin selected some of the top questions from the Q&A session of this presentation. Read more to dive deeper into tactics on how to apply agile methodologies.

在这里，Heather和Justin从本次演示的问答环节中选择了一些最热门的问题，阅读更多内容，深入了解如何应用敏捷方法方法的策略。

Q1: Digital agile board vs. physical agile board? What’s your take on them?

你怎么看待数字敏捷看板和物流敏捷看板？

A1: It really depends on your team setup. Are you all in the same place? How big is your team? Do you have space for a big physical board? We have done both at Gilt, but have found that as we grow and expand to dozens of teams that the agile boards in JIRA Software are more practical than physical boards. They are easier to set up and make changes to, and easier to share with remote team members. What we love about physical boards is that you just can’t ignore them, they are so in your face. And they are a great place to hold impromptu discussions about current work, or to have stand-ups if you do those.

这实际上取决于你的团队设置，你们都在同一个地方嘛？你们团队有多大？你们有空间放一块大的物理看板嘛？在Gilt中，这两种我们都做过，但是随着我们的成长扩展到数十个团队，我们发现JIRA Software 比物理看板更实用。因为他们更容易设置和修改，同时更容易与远程团队成员共享。我们喜欢物理看板的原因是我们不能忽略它，它就在你面前，同时他们会随时出现在即兴讨论当前工作或者举行站立会议时的好地方。

Q2: How can you work with a manager or client who does not follow or understand the agile process? I feel like an unsuccessful workflow coach sometimes.

你如何与不遵循或理解敏捷流程的经理或者客户合作？有时我觉得自己是一个不成功的工作流程教练。

A2: It’s important to think about your order of operations. If you are trying to work in an agile process with people who don’t believe in it, then you are jumping the gun a bit. The most important part of making this work is to gain consensus in the philosophy before you execute a process. We have done this in the past by looking at specific problems that a team is having with the current process and solving them in an agile way. Can you walk your manager or client through real problems they’re trying to solve and how you would approach it in an agile framework? Can you take them bit by bit towards becoming agile, rather than in a big changeover of the total process? You can then start to show real results this way, incrementally, as the team is working better. In short, take an Agile approach to going Agile. ;)

思考你的操作顺序很重要，如果你试图与不相信敏捷流程的人一起工作，这就有点恼火了。使这项工作最重要的部分是在执行流程之前在理念上达成一致。过去，我们通过查看团队在当前流程中遇到的具体问题并以敏捷的方式解决这些问题来做到这一点。你能否带领你的经理或者客户解决他们试图解决的实际问题，以及你将如何在敏捷框架中解决这些问题，你能不能一点一点地让他们变得敏捷，而不是整个过程的大转变。然后，随着团队工作的更好，你可以开始以这种方式逐步展示真实成果，简而言之，采用敏捷方法实现敏捷。

Q3: How can you implement an Agile process when the project is fixed bid and/or fixed schedule with a set list of requirements to implement?

当项目是固定投标或有固定时间表并有一系列要实施的要求时，你如何实施敏捷流程？

A3: First off, it is impossible to complete a project successfully given a fixed schedule AND a fixed list of requirements to implement, so is there a way to get everyone to agree that this is Fantasy Land? Most constraints around deadlines and requirements are not true constraints: they are wishes. Start discussing why you are doing the work, or what is the problem that you are trying to solve. If you truly understand the goals of the project and the reasons for the constraints, you can make sure that the team is doing the right work at the right time. Writing all the requirements down with dates next to them doesn’t magically make everything happen on time.

首先，给定一个固定的时间表和一个固定的要实施的需求清单是不可能成功完成一个项目的，那么有没有办法让每个人都同意这是幻想之地？大多数关于截止日期和需求的约束不是真正的约束：都是愿望。开始去讨论你为什么要做这项工作，或者你试图解决的问题是什么。如果你真正的理解项目的目标和限制的原因，你就可以确保团队是在正确的时间做正确的工作，把所有的需求写下来并附上日期并不能神奇的让一切都准时发生。

Q4: Most projects have a release date that usually is communicated to partners and customers. In this scenario, the only negotiable thing is the feature set (although some compromise on quality). How do you work within the constraints of a firm deadline?

大多数项目都有一个发布日期，通常会与合作伙伴和客户进行沟通。在这种情况下，唯一可以妥协的就是功能列表（即使在质量上有所妥协），你如何在确定的截止日期的约束下工作？

A4: We think you answered this yourself — you do this by negotiating scope. If you don’t, you are right that quality will suffer. Thinking that you can just jam in the scope regardless is a dream — you need to make sure your teams are working with reality, even if it’s not what people want to hear. Heather wrote a short blog post on this which you can read here.

我们认为你自己回答了这个问题，通过协商交付范围来做到这一点。如果你不这样做，那么你说的是对的，也就是质量会受到影响，认为无论如何都可以在交付范围内即兴发挥是一个梦想，你需要确保你的团队是在现实社会中工作，即使这不是人们想听到的。Heather写了一篇关于此的简短的博客文章，你可以在此阅读。

Q5: How do you think the way scrum is implemented should be changed?

你认为应该如何改变scrum的实施方式？

A5: The rigidity of scrum is our biggest problem with it. To think that a single highly-prescriptive process will work for all teams, regardless of what they are working on, and who they are is presumptuous. We have seen it work for teams, but scrum is not the only way to be agile, and a lot of teams fail with agile because they think they have to implement scrum in a specific way with all of the prescribed job roles, user stories, acceptance criteria, meetings, and artifacts. Heather also has an issue with the title “Scrum Master.” ;)

scrum的僵化是我们最大的问题，认为一个高度规范的流程适用所有的团队，无论他们在做什么，他们是谁，这样是很冒昧的。我们已经看到它适用于团队，但是scrum不是敏捷的唯一方式，而且很多团队在敏捷上都失败了，因为他们认为必须以特定的方式实施scrum，包括所有规定的工作角色，用户故事，验收标准，会议和工件。Heather对“Scrum Master.”这个头衔也有疑问。

Q6: How can you prevent stakeholders from directly influencing the team members?

如何防止利益相关者直接影响团队成员？

A6: Well, a good stakeholder IS a team member. So ideally bring the key stakeholder into your team so you can all work together! If you have the kind of stakeholders that just throw things over the wall to your team, or swoop in during the project and try to change everything, it’s important that the whole team understands what they are doing and why. So no matter who stakeholders talk to they will get the same answer. That’s what makes you a team rather than a collection of individuals. You need to communicate — a lot — and ensure everyone is on the same page and moving in the same direction.

好吧，好的利益相关者是团队成员。因此，理想情况下，将关键利益相关者带入你的团队，这样你们就可以一起工作。如果你的利益相关者只把事情扔给你的团队，或者在项目期间突然介入并试图改变一切，那么整个团队了解在做什么以及为什么这么做就非常重要。因为，无论利益相关者和谁交谈，都会得到相同的答案。这就是你们成为一个团队而不是一群人的原因，你需要沟通，大量的沟通，确保每个人都在同一个平面上并朝着同一个目标前进。

Q7: Do you estimate stories based on rough order of magnitude estimates (in hours) or based on points?

你是根据粗略的数量级估计(以小时为单位)，还是点来估计用户故事？

A7: We do both, and some teams don’t estimate at all. Points are great because they are more abstract, and are not tied to any specific calendar time. Hours can be helpful as a transition if your team is resisting estimation since it is more tangible. The point of estimating is to be able to tell whether your sprint is too heavy or too light and adjust, and they really serve no purpose once the sprint starts. We find that once you have worked with a team for a while, the estimation process becomes unnecessary. We can all look at the work and tell pretty easily whether it is the right amount for the sprint.

我们两者都在做，而且有些团队都不估计。点很棒，因为它是抽象的，而且与任何特点的日历时间都没关系。如果你的团队拒绝估算，那么小时数作为过渡可能有用，因为它更加有形。估算的重点是判断冲刺是太重还是太轻并进行调整，一旦冲刺开始，它们就真的没有用了。我们发现一旦与团队合作了一段时间，估算过程就变得没那么必要了，我们都可以查看工作并判断它是否适合sprint。

Q8: How much value do you put in project leads/managers having deep analysis skills and product knowledge vs. just coordinating meetings between tech and biz stakeholders to gather requirements?

与只是协调技术和商业利益相关者之间的会议来收集需求相比，你对具有深度分析技能和产品知识的项目负责人/经理的价值有多大？

A8: Pretty much all the value :) Coordinating meetings, taking notes, etc… are not specialized skills. Anyone can do them. While it is important that they happen, it is not really the biggest value-add you can provide for the team. If all you are doing is administrative work, then the team is right to question why you are a part of it. Everyone in the PMO at Gilt has a deep understanding of the relevant subject matter and the tools and techniques to get work done and they bring that with them to every team they work on. Many of us were engineers previously or worked with other departments at Gilt and bring with us unique subject matter expertise.

几乎所有的价值：协调会议，记录笔记，等等，都不是专业技能。任何人都可以做到，尽管他们发生发生时是很重要，但这并不是你能提供给团队的最大附加价值。如果你正在做的只是行政工作，那么团队就只会质疑你为什么参与其中。Gilt中的PMO每个人都对相关主题以及完成工作的工具和技术都有深度的理解，并将其带到他们工作的每个团队中。我们中的许多人以前是工程师，或者在Gilt的其他部门工作过，都能为我们带来独一无二的主题专业知识。

Q9: Generally how large are the teams and what background do people have at Gilt?

一般来说，Gilt的团队有多大，团队成员都有什么背景。

A9: Ideally we want our teams to be lean but large enough to be self-sufficient, allowing them to move forward on projects without dependencies on other teams. We follow the ‘two pizza’ rule: teams should be able to be fed by two pizzas. We also feel strongly that each individual on the team brings with them a set of unique talents, and they should be able to bring those talents to the team regardless of what their job title is. So if, traditionally, the product owner is responsible for all presentations, but they stink at it and if there’s an engineer who is amazing at storytelling and winning over an audience, we’re going to let the engineer bring that talent to the team. You are more than your job title!

理想情况下，我们希望团队精干但足够大到能自给自足，允许他们在不依赖其他团队的情况下推动项目。我们遵循“两个披萨”的规则：团队能被两个披萨喂饱。我们强烈的感受到团队中的每个人带来一系列独一无二的才能，无论他的职位是什么，他们都应该把这些才能带入到团队中。因此，传统上，产品负责人负责所有演示，但他们对此很讨厌，如果有个在讲故事和赢得观众方面很出色的工程师，我们就会让这个工程师把这个才能带到团队中，在团队中，你不仅仅只是你的职位那样的角色。

Q10: How do you manage a separate QA team, especially where testing may occur in a different sprint from development?

如何单独的管理一个QA团队，特别是在测试可能发生在与开发不一样的sprint的情况下？

A10: This is one of the more controversial positions that we take, but we don’t have a separate QA team at Gilt. We believe in automation testing throughout the development and deploy process. Teams are responsible for the quality of their code. If you have the time and expertise to write code, you have the time and expertise to write tests for it. Throwing this over the wall to a QA team has never shown good results for us, and requires a lot of additional documentation and time to bring QA teams up to speed.

这个是我们发现的最具争议的立场之一，单我们在在Gilt没有单独的QA团队。我们相信在开发和部署过程中都会进行自动化测试，团队成员会为他们代码的质量负责，如果你有时间和专业知识编写代码，那么你就有时间和专业知识为其编写测试用例。把这个问题扔给QA团队并不会为我们带来好的结果，因为需要大量的额外的文档和时间来让QA团队跟上进度。

Q11: If you have teams that work on several ‘products’ simultaneously, would it work to have all product managers in the room during sprint planning and have them determine relative priorities across products? Any other ideas?

如果你的团队同时处理多个产品，在sprint期间，让所有的产品经理在房间内并让他们确定产品之间的相对优先级是否可行？还有其他建议嘛？

A11: Stop! Clearly this isn’t going to work. The team should have a product manager of its own and not be working on multiple products for multiple product managers who are outside of the team. Whomever is acting as the team lead should step-up here and clearly outline the team’s methodology for prioritization, and in what order they are going to tackle the execution of that work based on this methodology. It ties back into our point that, “you have to be aligned on your methodology before you can put a process into place.”

停止，这显然行不通。这个团队需要有一个他们自己的产品经理，而不是为团队之外的多个产品经理开发多个产品。作为团队负责人的任何人都应该在这里加强并清晰的概述团队的优先级排序方法，以及他们将根据此方法解决工作的执行顺序。这与我们的观点有关，在流程落地之前，你们必须在方法论上保持一致。

Q12: I am trying to get a marketing creative services team into agile. We have some deliverables that HAVE to be delivered on a certain date (designing an ad to print in a magazine). How do we fit these projects into agile framework?

我试图让营销创意团队变得敏捷，我们有一些必须在特定日期交付的可交付成果（设计要在杂纸上印刷的广告）。我们如何将这些项目融入到敏捷框架中？

A12: Agile is able to handle constraints like this. It is up to the team to identify what has to be done and by when and to plan sprints accordingly. Agile should help you hit these deadlines since it gives you the ability to adjust your priorities and your planned work (scope) every sprint. If you start tracking your velocity, you’ll soon be able to tell whether or not you’re going to hit those deadlines sooner rather than later. It’s then up to a good team leader to be able to negotiate what the team needs to be successful.

敏捷能够处理这些约束，由团队确定必须完成什么以及什么时候完成并响应的计划冲刺。敏捷应该能帮助你按时完成这些期限，因为它有能力在每个sprint中调整你的优先级和你计划的工作（范围），如果你开始追踪你的速度，你很快就能知道你是否会早点而不是晚点赶上最终交付期限。然后取决于一个好的团队领导者去协商团队需要什么才能成功。

Q13: Doesn’t changing goals seem like scope creep?

改变目标是不是看起来像范围蔓延？

A13: Yes it does, but we don’t call it ‘scope creep’ because we want to encourage change during a project. One of the biggest advantages of an agile philosophy is that it allows you to adapt to things that are outside of your control. If the competitive landscape changes, or the needs of your business change, or there is new technology available, do you really want to plod on through the requirements matrix that was made months ago? If you want to deliver the best product for your customer, embrace change and use it to your advantage. There is no ‘scope creep’ in agile (insert Jedi mind-trick here).

是的，确实如此，但是我们不称之为“范围蔓延”，因为我们鼓励在项目机器更改。敏捷哲学的最大优点就是允许你适应超过你控制范围外的事情。如果竞争格局发生变化，或者你的业务需求发生变化，或者有的新的技术可用，你是否真的想继续完成几个月前制定的需求矩阵？如果你想交付给你的客户最好的产品，拥抱变化并把它作为你的优势，在敏捷中没有范围蔓延（在此处插入绝地思维技巧）
