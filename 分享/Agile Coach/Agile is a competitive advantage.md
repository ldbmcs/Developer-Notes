# Report: agile is the competitive advantage for a digital age

报告：敏捷是数字时代的具有竞争力的优势

Harvard Business Review Analytic Services throws its weight behind agile development

哈佛商业评论分析服务大力支持敏捷开发

In a new report, Harvard Business Review Analytic Services dubbed agile software development “the competitive advantage for a digital age.” Not the most colorful proclamation of all-time, maybe, but this is the Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. Wait a minute. This is the Harvard Business Review Analytic Services. And they're saying agile software development has “become a trusted and preferred method of development for software teams everywhere”?

在一份新的报告中，哈佛商业评论分析服务将敏捷开发称为“数字时代具有竞争力的优势”，也行这不是有史以来最丰富多彩的宣言，但是这是哈佛商业评论分析服务，等一下，这是哈佛商业评论分析服务，他们说敏捷软件开发以及成为各地软件开发团队值得信赖和首选的开发方法。

Yep. True story. (Full disclosure: Atlassian partnered with Harvard Business Review Analytic Services to produce the report, and we're all about agile. But the truth remains!) What the report outlines is that a shift in development trends has happened. With so much competition out there, software development teams must meet customer needs faster. Before, that is, a competitor beats them to it. Moving to more agile forms of software planning and delivering helps teams do just that. But it's more than that. Agile helps organizations in multiple industries improve product quality, time to market, and employee satisfaction.

是的，这是一个真实的故事（全面披露：Atlassian和哈佛商业评论分析服务合作制作了这份报告，我们都是关于敏捷的，但是事实仍然存在）。报告的概述是发展趋势发生了改变，软件开发必须更快的满足客户需求。转向更敏捷的软件规划和交付形式有助于团队做到这一点，也就是说击败竞争对手。不仅如此，敏捷帮助不同行业的组织提高产品质量，上市时间以及员工满意度。

敏捷开发的承诺

根据国际基准：敏捷软件开发在不同领域都提供了巨大的好处。

|开发目标|提高敏捷性|
|---|---|
|质量|缺陷逃逸率下降|
|上市时间|提高18-20%(因为行业差异，提高的范围也不一样)|
|生产力|提高14-95%(因为正在构建的软件类型不一样，提高的范围也完全不一样)|
|成本|成本减少7-29%|
|员工满意度|提高20-40%|

> 缺陷逃逸率：软件产品发布后发现的缺陷数量与该软件产品在整个生命周期发现的所有缺陷数量的比率。

The thing to keep in mind, however, is that “doing agile right is not a cosmetic fix, but something that companies need to dedicate time and resources to in several key areas.” So, it takes some time. What's good in life that doesn't take a little time and dedication?

然而，要记住的是，正确的实施敏捷，而不是表面的修复，公司需要在几个关键的领域投入时间和资源的事情。所以，这需要一些时间，生活中有什么是不需要一点时间和奉献的呢？

The Harvard Business Review Analytic Services has weighed in and pound-for-pound agile tops the list of development methods.

哈佛商业评论分析服务已经将敏捷开发作为软件开发方法之首。
